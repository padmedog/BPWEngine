# BPWEngine
The BPW Engine is an engine I have been working on for many months (about a year now at the time of writing this).
It is supposed to have many features of a 3D engine, I guess. I haven't really thought of a goal except to keep adding great things to it.

The greatest achievement in my engine is 360 view rotation on all three axes, which is what I developed first.

The problem of other things being unable to rotate arose. This was due to the way I displayed the world to the view.

Rather than the camera moving around the world, the world moved around the camera, which let me rotate the world around the 0,0,0 point, whereas I couldn't rotate the world around other points at the time

I currently have support for rotating around the Z axis (up and down within the game world), which took a bit of tinkering to figure out.

Some other things that the engine has is 3D collisions, head bobbing, footsteps (kind of faulty), menues, options (needs external file), dozenal conversion, somewhat minimap support (used to work, don't know what went wrong), 3D trigonometry, screen shaking, and probably other things I cannot think of at the moment.
