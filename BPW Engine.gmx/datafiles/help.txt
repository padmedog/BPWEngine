1. Controls
-Move: WASD
-Look: Mouse

2. View
The view for this engine is mostly unlike any other normal view.
The best thing about it is that it supported view rotation,
not only on the 2 axises, pitch and direction, it adds another
for the rotation of the view.
-Z Axis is for direction
-Y Axis is for pitch
-X Axis is for rotation


3. Minimap
The minimap basically takes certain blocks, draws them to a surface,
then draws a part of the surface on the top right of the screen.
